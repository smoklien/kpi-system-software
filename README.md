# System Software Lab Works Repository

This repository is my one-stop shop for the source code, documentation, and reports for my System Software Lab works. Get access to various labs, explore their details, and utilize provided resources to effectively complete your assignments.

## Repository structure

- `docs`: This folder contains documentation and reports for the lab works.
- `lab-x`: Each lab has its dedicated directory prefixed with `lab-x`, where `x` represents the specific lab number (e.g., `lab-1`, `lab-2`).
- `.gitignore`: Files or folders to ignore.
